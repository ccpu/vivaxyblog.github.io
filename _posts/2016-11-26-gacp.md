More than one year age, I came up with an idea to make git commit more easily. So I made [`gcmt`](https://github.com/vivaxy/gcmt). See [this post](/2015/08/23/git-commit-script.html) for details.

Inspired by [`commitizen`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and [`gitmoji`](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli), I have shifted [`gcmt`](https://github.com/vivaxy/gcmt) into [`gacp`](https://github.com/vivaxy/gacp).

[`commitizen`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) can make it easier to bump version and maintain change log through [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).

[`gitmoji`](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) adds emoji into git commit, which also brings more fun.

Tools I have mentioned above are written in javascript. Also, it's not easy to change keyboard inputs into which they really means in shell scripts. Using arrow keys to navigate within a prompt is always not working. However, it prints keyboard code. So I decided to make [`gacp`](https://github.com/vivaxy/gacp) by javascript.

Steps when using [`gacp`](https://github.com/vivaxy/gacp) as your commit script.

Type `gacp` in your git repositories.

Choose the type of your changes.

Enter the subject of your changing.

With help of [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), we can easily maintain version and change log.

Setup [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) in `package.json`.

Run `npm run release` to bump version and generate `CHANGELOG.md`.

The output of `CHANGELOG.md`

The versioning and changeloging part is optional. By using [`gacp`](https://github.com/vivaxy/gacp), you can still keeping your commit well-organized, pretty and much interesting.
